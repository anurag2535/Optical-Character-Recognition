# Optical-Character-Recognition
From teenager's to averagely old aged person we see the problem of the eye where the person is not able to read or see the objects which are closer to their eyes which in medical terms also known as "Myopia". It is believed that the number of people who faces the issue of myopia is more then 30% of the entire global population which is around 2.25 billion. And along with the issue of myopia according to BBC news more than 35 million people around world is blind and this number is expected to grow with the time. 
So, we with our idea want to help those people who sometimes feels disabled about their visual impairment. With the machine learning technology and computer vision technology we can actually make their ears their eyes. 
The features we want to introduce in out applications are as follows: 
1) Face recognition. 
2) OCR Technology. 
3) Realtime handwriting translator. 
And many more.... 
There are few other companies who provides the users with some of these features in their application but almost all of them charge a good amount of money for solution. But on the other hand, we with the help of smartphones are able to implement these features on any basic smartphone without any further device requirements. So, users won't have to pay any extra penny. 
Using OCR, we can read texts from any printed material and using cloud technology we will make it enormously reliable. Using face recognition as a feature intends to identify the person with whom the blind person meets.  
We really have a huge group of people who need our assistance so why not take a step and make the change we want to see.
